# Trees and BST

## Theory

### Tree
A non-linear hierarchical data structure.
*   **Root**: Top node.
*   **Child**: Nodes connected downwards.
*   **Leaf**: Node with no children.

### Binary Tree
A tree where each node has at most two children.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary tree where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is greater.

## Implementation Details
- `src/BinaryTree.java`: Basic structure.
- `src/BST.java`: Implementation with insert and search.
