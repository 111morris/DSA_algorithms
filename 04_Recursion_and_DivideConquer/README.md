# Recursion and Divide & Conquer

## Theory

### Recursion
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.
*   **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursion ends.
*   **Recursive Case**: The logic where the function calls itself.

### Divide & Conquer
A paradigm that breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves the sub-problems, and combines the results.
1.  **Divide**: Break into sub-problems.
2.  **Conquer**: Recursively solve sub-problems.
3.  **Combine**: Merge solutions.

## Implementation Details
- `src/RecursionExamples.java`: Examples like Factorial, Fibonacci.
