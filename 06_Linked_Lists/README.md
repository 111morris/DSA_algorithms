# Linked Lists

## Theory
A linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

*   **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
*   **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to next and previous.
*   **Circular Linked List**: Last node points to first node.

## Implementation Details
- `src/LinkedList.java`: Singly Linked List with `add`, `addFirst`, `delete` operations.
