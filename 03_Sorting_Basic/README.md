# Sorting (Basic)

## Theory

### Bubble Sort
Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
*   **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)

### Selection Sort
Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items.
*   **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort
Builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
*   **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
